# How to see the project

## What to install
1. On a powershell terminal write `npm i`.
2. Then after installing all the node modules, write `npm i @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux react-router-dom json-server`.
 
These are all the installation needed to run the project.

## How to start
### This is VERY IMPORTANT, on a powershell terminal write `json-server --watch db.json -p 3001`, it connects with the database and login/register/liked songs will not work without it.

Now write `npm start` and enjoy the project
