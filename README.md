#How to start the project

##What to install
On a powershell terminal write `npm i`
Then after installing all the node modules, write this `npm i @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux react-router-dom json-server`
These are all the installation needed to run the project

##How to start
#1. This is VERY IMPORTANT, on a powershell terminal write `json-server --watch db.json -p 3001`, it starts a fake rest API and login/register/liked songs will not work without it.
2. Now write `npm start` and enjoy the project
